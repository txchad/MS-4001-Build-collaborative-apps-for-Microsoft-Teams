**Note**:  The exercises in this module use Teams Toolkit v5.8.0. Please note that minor versions may vary.

You can also install Teams Toolkit from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).

## Task 2: Prepare your Microsoft 365 work or school account

If you already have admin access to a Microsoft 365 work or school account that is suitable for development and testing, you can use that account to run and debug your app. Be sure to use a tenant that is safe to perform operations in without impacting real users.

Otherwise, you can create a free test account using the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://aka.ms/m365developers).  After the setup is completed, the Microsoft 365 Developer Program will provide you with admin access to a tenant that you can use for building Teams apps.

## Task 3: Configure your Microsoft 365 tenant to upload apps for Teams

Turn on custom app uploading for your tenant by following these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com) with your **Microsoft 365 admin credentials**.

2. From the sidebar, select **Teams apps**, and then select **Setup policies**.

3. Select the **Global (Org-wide default) policy**, and then turn on the **Upload custom apps** toggle.

4. Select the **Save** button to save your changes. Your tenant is now configured to allow custom app sideloading.

In the next unit, you'll learn how to create a Teams app and run it locally in Teams.
